    <div class="bio">
    <p>Adaptable, dynamic professional seeking the next adventure in life. I’ve been a writer, photographer, community leader, chef, and Jiu Jitsu player. Currently, I love being a parent, husband, and inspiration to my two beautiful children, and the anchor for my amazing wife.
I believe my professional and personal experiences culminate into a singular truth:<p>
<p> I make wonderful waffles. </p>
<p>While the previous statement is meant to provide color commentary for this profile page, it is a real example of my own, personal waffle recipe. See, I’ve been working on this recipe for some time. It has gone through dozens of iterations and branched towards many dead ends. My working waffle batter recipe, over the years, persists to become better with each version in order to obtain the following:</p>
myWaffles  >= “DELICIOUS”

<p>Alas, deliciousness is always dictated by the audience. I hope that one day, myWaffles will fit and excel in a variety of palates.</p>

<p>The same can be said of my own skill set. A great chef once told me:</p>
“If you’re not learning, you’re dying.”
<p>I NEED to learn something new every day. Whether it is a concept or even an insight to a friend or coworker, it is ingrained in my head to pursue knowledge.</p>
<p>So here I am, communicating my desire to become better in the world of software development through old Chef quotes and waffles. Please know, dear reader, that this life is a wonderful journey.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing in my adventure.</p>
