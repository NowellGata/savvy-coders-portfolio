    <p class="lead"> Adaptable, dynamic professional seeking the next adventure in life. I’ve been a writer, photographer, community leader, chef, and Jiu Jitsu player. Currently, I love being a parent, husband, and inspiration to my two beautiful children, and the anchor for my amazing wife.

    <hr></hr>
    <p class="lead">I NEED to learn something new every day. Whether it is a concept or even an insight to a friend or coworker, it is ingrained in my head to pursue knowledge.</p>
    <hr></hr>
    <p class="lead">So here I am, communicating my desire to become better in the world of software development through old Chef quotes and waffles. Please know, dear reader, that this life is a wonderful journey.</p>

    <p class="lead">Thank you for sharing in my adventure.</p>
