            There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force
            and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them. Several
            fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six...
            Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge!
