            Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I want this site to serve as a benchmark for my progress in programming and web development. I am currently working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6), NodeJS. In the next few months, I hope to increase my fluency in the mentioned languages, as well as start on a path towards fluency in Python.
